## HW2: Linear Discriminant Analysis, due date: May 8, 23:59

### Goals
In hw2, you need to implement Fisher’s linear discriminant by using only numpy, then train your implemented model by the provided dataset and test the performance with testing data

Please note that only **NUMPY** can be used to implement your model, you will get no points by simply calling sklearn.discriminant_analysis.LinearDiscriminantAnalysis
